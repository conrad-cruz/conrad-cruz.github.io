Taking a step further with League of Legends, I first generate a SQLite Database file using [Riot Game's API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) which involves generating various lists of python code.

Then, another database is created by scraping the website of [Counterstats.net](https://www.counterstats.net/) to score each champion's best counter and worst counter based on lane matchups.

Finally, all the data is cleaned and a model is made to attempt to predict the outcome of a match based off of a match's champion selection using various machine learning tools. Ultimately the model was unable to be improved past 50% prediction accuracy. However, this could be a sign into how balanced the game could be at the moment; if a match could be predicted reliably based on champions picked alone, it may not be a sign of a balanced game!
