### League of Legends Champion Match Outcome Prediction

Taking a step further with League of Legends, I first generate a SQLite Database file using [Riot Game's API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) which involves generating various lists of python code. Then, another database is created by scraping the website of [Counterstats.net](https://www.counterstats.net/) to score each champion's best counter and worst counter based on lane matchups. 


Finally, all the data is cleaned and a model is made to attempt to predict the outcome of a match based off of a match's champion selection.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/conrad-cruz/conrad-cruz.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
